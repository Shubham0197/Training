HTML - Hyper Text Markup Language
It describes the structure of a web page
It consists of a series of elements
Elements tell the browser how to display the content


HTML Page Structure
Below is a visualization of an HTML page structure:

<html>
<head>
<title>Page title</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<p>This is another paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>



HTMl Elements 
The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document
The <html> element is the root element of an HTML page
The <head> element contains meta information about the HTML page
The <title> element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab)
The <body> element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
The <h1> element defines a large heading
The <p> element defines a paragraph

HTML Elements
An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag.
Elements can be nested and HTML document is of nested html elements.
The <html> element is the root element and it defines the whole HTML document.
It has a start tag <html> and an end tag </html>.
Then, inside the <html> element there is a <body> element

There are some elements tag which need end tag 
for them there is need for them to not skip end tag but they will work without them .
And there is are also elements called Empty HTML elements like <br> tag

HTML is Not Case Sensitive
HTML tags are not case sensitive: <P> means the same as <p>.
The HTML standard does not require lowercase tags, but W3C recommends lowercase in HTML, 
and demands lowercase for stricter document types like XHTML.

====================================================
## HTML Attributes
HTML attributes provide additional information about HTML elements.

All HTML elements can have attributes
Attributes provide additional information about elements
Attributes are always specified in the start tag
Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"
 href attribute of <a> tag
 src attribute of <img> tag
 width and height attributes for img tag
 alt attribute for the <img> tag -  it gives the alternate name if image is not displayed

=>  Always Quote Attribute Values

Single or Double Quotes?
Both of them are acceptable and double are common.
when the attribute value itself contains double quotes, it is necessary to use single quotes.
====================================================
HTML Headings
HTML headings are titles or subtitles that you want to display on a webpage.
headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags.

<h1> defines the most important heading. 
<h6> defines the least important heading.

Headings Are Important as Search engines use the headings to index the structure and content of your web pages.

We can define bigger heading instead of the default size can increaze the size using the font-size property of css


==================================================
## HTML Paragraphs
A paragraph always starts on a new line, and is usually a block of text.

A paragraph always starts on a new line, 
and browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a paragraph.

With html cannot be certain how will it display body 
With HTML cannot change the display by adding extra spaces or extra lines in your HTML code.
The browser will automatically remove any extra spaces and lines when the page is displayed.

HTML Horizontal Rules - <hr> is  displayed as a horizontal rule.

The HTML <br> element defines a line break.

Can also use the preformatted text means it will display what is written as it is written like it is preformatted.
 The HTML <pre> element defines preformatted text.

The text inside a <pre> element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier),
 and it preserves both spaces and line breaks

External - by using a <link>
element to link to an external CSS file

files.
