HTML - Hyper Text Markup Language
It describes the structure of a web page
It consists of a series of elements
Elements tell the browser how to display the content


HTML Page Structure
Below is a visualization of an HTML page structure:

<html>
<head>
<title>Page title</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<p>This is another paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>



HTMl Elements 
The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document
The <html> element is the root element of an HTML page
The <head> element contains meta information about the HTML page
The <title> element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab)
The <body> element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
The <h1> element defines a large heading
The <p> element defines a paragraph

HTML Elements
An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag.
Elements can be nested and HTML document is of nested html elements.
The <html> element is the root element and it defines the whole HTML document.
It has a start tag <html> and an end tag </html>.
Then, inside the <html> element there is a <body> element

There are some elements tag which need end tag 
for them there is need for them to not skip end tag but they will work without them .
And there is are also elements called Empty HTML elements like <br> tag

HTML is Not Case Sensitive
HTML tags are not case sensitive: <P> means the same as <p>.
The HTML standard does not require lowercase tags, but W3C recommends lowercase in HTML, 
and demands lowercase for stricter document types like XHTML.

====================================================
## HTML Attributes
HTML attributes provide additional information about HTML elements.

All HTML elements can have attributes
Attributes provide additional information about elements
Attributes are always specified in the start tag
Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"
 href attribute of <a> tag
 src attribute of <img> tag
 width and height attributes for img tag
 alt attribute for the <img> tag -  it gives the alternate name if image is not displayed

The style Attribute
The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more.

The lang Attribute
lang attribute inside the <html> tag, to declare the language of the Web page
<html lang="en">
The title Attribute
The title attribute defines some extra information about an element.
=>  Always Quote Attribute Values

Single or Double Quotes?
Both of them are acceptable and double are common.
when the attribute value itself contains double quotes, it is necessary to use single quotes.
====================================================
HTML Headings
HTML headings are titles or subtitles that you want to display on a webpage.
headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags.

<h1> defines the most important heading. 
<h6> defines the least important heading.

Headings Are Important as Search engines use the headings to index the structure and content of your web pages.

We can define bigger heading instead of the default size can increaze the size using the font-size property of css


==================================================
## HTML Paragraphs
A paragraph always starts on a new line, and is usually a block of text.
<p> element defines a paragraph
A paragraph always starts on a new line, 
and browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a paragraph.

With html cannot be certain how will it display body 
With HTML cannot change the display by adding extra spaces or extra lines in your HTML code.
The browser will automatically remove any extra spaces and lines when the page is displayed.

HTML Horizontal Rules - <hr> is  displayed as a horizontal rule.

The HTML <br> element defines a line break.

Can also use the preformatted text means it will display what is written as it is written like it is preformatted.
 The HTML <pre> element defines preformatted text.

The text inside a <pre> element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier),
 and it preserves both spaces and line breaks


===============================================================================================

the current text direction: using attribute attr

HTML Comments

HTML comments are not displayed in the browser,
 but they can help document your HTML source code.
Syntax 
<!-- Write your comments here -->
this can be used to hide the HTML tags and iinline contents too .

HTML Colors

HTML colors are specified with predefined color names, or with RGB, HEX, HSL, RGBA, or HSLA values.

Border Color

style="border:2px solid Tomato;"

Color Values
<h1 style="background-color:rgb(255, 99, 71);">...</h1>
<h1 style="background-color:#ff6347;">...</h1>
<h1 style="background-color:hsl(9, 100%, 64%);">...</h1>

<h1 style="background-color:rgba(255, 99, 71, 0.5);">...</h1>

An RGB color value represents RED, GREEN, and BLUE light sources. rgb(red, green, blue)
An RGBA color value is an extension of RGB with an
Alpha channel (opacity).

HTML HEX Colors

In HTML, a color can be specified using a hexadecimal value in the form:

#rrggbb
Where rr (red), gg (green) and bb (blue) are hexadecimal values between 00 and ff (same as decimal 0-255).
Shades of Gray
Shades of gray are often defined using equal values for all three parameters:

hsl(hue, saturation, lightness)

=====================================================


HTML Styles - CSS
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to format the layout of a webpage.

CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:
Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements
An inline CSS is used to apply a unique style to a single HTML element.
An inline CSS uses the style attribute of an HTML element.


Internal - by using a <style> element in the <head> section
An internal CSS is used to define a style for a single HTML page.

An internal CSS is defined in the <head> section of an HTML page, within a <style> element.



External - by using a <link>
element to link to an external CSS file
An external style sheet is used to define the style for many HTML pages.
To use an external style sheet, add a link to it in the <head> section of each HTML page

 The extenal file must not contain any
HTML code, and must be saved with a .css extension.
Syntax to specify external css in html head
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">

The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS
files.



Use the CSS border property for borders
Use the CSS padding property for space inside the border
Use the CSS margin property for space outside the border

Use the CSS color property for text colors
Use the CSS font-family property for text fonts
Use the CSS font-size property for text sizes
Use the CSS border property for borders
Use the CSS padding property for space inside the border
Use the CSS margin property for space outside the border

===================================================
## HTML Links

Links allow users to click their way from page to page.
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">Visit W3Schools.com!</a>

By default, links will appear as follows in all browsers:
An unvisited link is underlined and blue
A visited link is underlined and purple
An active link is underlined and red

The target Attribute
By default, the linked page will be displayed in the current browser window. 
To change this, you must specify another target for the link.
The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document.

_self - Default. Opens the document in
the same window/tab as it was clicked
_blank - Opens the document in a new window or tab
_parent - Opens the document in the parent frame
_top - Opens the document in the full body of the window

absolute URL (a full web address) in the href attribute.

A local link (a link to a page within the same website) is specified with a relative URL 
(without the "https://www" part)
Use mailto: inside the href attribute to create a link that opens the user's email program (to let them send a new email)
<a href="mailto:someone@example.com">Send email</a>

HTML Links - Different Colors
Css element to change the behaviour 
a:link {
}
a:visited {
}
a:hover {
}
a:active {
}

Create a Bookmark in HTML - 
Link to the same page
Using id
Bookmarks can be useful if a web page is very long.
To create a bookmark - first create the bookmark, then add a link
to it.
When the link is clicked, the page will scroll down or up to the location with the
bookmark.

Use the id attribute (id="value") to define bookmarks in a page
Use the href attribute (href="#value") to link to the bookmark
Or can use the  (href="www.page.html#value") to go that part of page from another page .
================================================

## image HTML

To show image in html <img> tag is used and it has two required
attributes:
src - Specifies the path to the image

alt - Specifies an alternate text for the image
if no image is shown like description of the image

Image Size - Width and Height using direct as attribute or in the style attribute property.

Image can be be in the same folder or another folder, or on another server and website just have to give the correct address in the src attribute.

we can also give the animated imgaes to the img elements
and can also use the image as the link in the <a>  tag 

Image can also float using 
 the CSS float property let the image float to the right or to the left of a text.

 HTML Image Maps

 The HTML <map> tag defines an image map.
  An image map is an image with clickable areas. 
 The areas are defined with one or more <area> tags.
 The idea behind an image map is that you should be able to perform different actions depending on where in the image you click.
 he only difference from other images is that you must add a usemap attribute

 <img src="workplace.jpg" alt="Workplace" usemap="#workmap">
 Then, add a <map> element.
The <map> element is used to create an image map, and is linked to the image by using the required name attribute
<map name="workmap">
The area of the click in the image can be 
rectangle - need coordinate of the diagonal
circle - need coordinat eof the centre and radius
poly - need coordinate of the every corner.

<area shape= "rect" coords="34, 44, 270,350" href="link">

HTML Background Images
To add a background image on an HTML element, use the HTML style attribute and the CSS background-image property
<p style="background-image: url('img_girl.jpg');">

but if want to show background image for hte page have to give  in the body element tag
body {
  background-image: url('img_girl.jpg');
}

If the background image is smaller than the element, the image will repeat itself, horizontally and vertically, until it reaches the end of the element
So, To avoid the background image from repeating itself, set the background-repeat property
to no-repeat
Can also set background-size to cover to the cover the whole element.
Can   set  background-size: 100% 100%; to strech the image
  background-attachment: fixed; this property is used to make the image fixed and entire element is always covered.


HTML <picture> Element
The HTML <picture> element allows you to display different pictures for different devices or screen sizes.
The <picture> element contains one or more <source> elements, each referring to different images through the srcset attribute.
 This way the browser can choose the image that best fit the current view and/or device.
Each <source> element has a media attribute that defines when the image is the most suitable and in that will have to define the dimension whiich suits that image the most.
<picture>
  <source media="(min-width: 650px)" srcset="img_food.jpg">
  <source media="(min-width: 465px)" srcset="img_car.jpg">
  <img src="img_girl.jpg">
</picture>

This element is used for 2 main reasons
1. to save the bandwidth and to laosd the most appropriate image nned according to device as small device would need only small image.
and 2. would be the format support if one donot support some format it would give diffrent image format to show.


HTML Favicon - A favicon is a small image displayed next to the page title in the browser tab. it is the .ico file .

it is declared in the head element tag of the 
<link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="/images/favicon.ico">


=======================================================

HTML Block and Inline Elements

Every HTML element has a default display value , depending on what type of element it is.
There are two display values: block and inline.

Block 
A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.
THey take full width 
Two commonly used block elements are: <p> and <div>.

Inline Elements
An inline element does not start on a new line.
An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.
This is a <span> element inside a paragraph.


The <div> Element
The <div> element is often used as a container for other HTML elements.

The <div> element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common.
They are used to style the content in it.

The <span> Element
The <span> element is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document.
they are like the div but inline and used to style the content in it.


HTML class Attribute

The HTML class attribute is used to specify a class for an HTML element.
eg: <h2 class="city">London</h2>
In the styles or css
To create a class; write a period (.) character, followed by a class name. Then, define the CSS properties within curly braces {}
HTML elements can belong to more than one class.
To define multiple classes, separate the class names with a space, e.g. <div class="city main">.
Here 2 classes city and main
Different Elements Can Share Same Class
The class name can also be used by JavaScript to perform certain tasks for specific elements.
JavaScript can access elements with a specific class name with the getElementsByClassName() method.

HTML id Attribute
The HTML id attribute is used
to specify a unique id for an HTML element.
You cannot have more than one element with the same id in an HTML document.
The id attribute is used to point to a specific style declaration in a style sheet. 
It is also used by JavaScript to access and manipulate the element with the specific id.
In the css file The syntax for id is: write a hash character (#), followed by an id name.
Then, define the CSS properties within curly braces {}.

===================================================
Html Tables
it is defined using the <table> tag
Table has row define by the <tr>
and   
Each table cell is defined by a <td> and a </td> tag.

The table header will be defined int he table rows usnig <th> instead of the <td> for columns

Table borders


Difference Between Class and ID
A class name can be used by multiple HTML elements, while an id name must only be used by one HTML element within the page
ID helps with the bookmarks and links in the HTML page.
The id attribute can also be used by JavaScript to perform some tasks for that specific element.

When you add a border to a table, you also add borders around each table cell 	 	 
To add a border, use the CSS border property on table, th, and td elements.
table, th, td
{
  border: 1px solid black;
}

By default it is the double border to not have double border set the property 
border-collapse property to collapse

Can also set the background color of the cells
also can set the color of the border as background color to give the impression of the invisible border.{border-color:red;}
Can also set the radius of the cell border to have round table border.  border-radius: 10px;
Dotted table border is also possible with
border-style

The following values are allowed:
dotted     
dashed     
solid     
double     
groove     
ridge     
inset     
outset     
none     
hidden     

Table Size
Can set the table width and height for each individualy table , tr, or td/th tag


HTML Table headers
Instead of the td whihc is for table data have to define header with <th> tag.
Which specifies the heading in the first row of the table if done <th> in 1st <tr> tag.
or can also give verticle table header with 1st column as <th> for every <tr>

text-align property can help to set the alignment of the text in the table cells.
left, right, center

Table Caption
You can add a caption that serves as a heading for the entire table.
using the <caption> tag:
  <caption>Monthly savings</caption>


HTML Table Padding & Spacing

HTML tables can adjust the padding inside the cells, and also the space between the cells.

Cell padding is the space between the cell edges and the cell content.
 CSS padding : padding: 15px;
 the padding can be individually decided 
 using the padding-top, padding-bottom, padding-left, and padding-right properties.


 Cell spacing is the space between each cell.
 By default it is 2px.

HTML Table 
Colspan - To make a cell span over multiple columns
Rowspan - To make a cell span over multiple rows

HTML Table Styling

HTML Table - Zebra Stripes
To style every other table row element, use the :nth-child(even)
HTML Table - Vertical Zebra Stripes
Set the :nth-child(even) for table data elements like this
Combine Vertical and Horizontal Zebra Stripes haveto use above two property simultaneously.
Can also define Horizontal Dividers have to add the border-bottom property to all tr elements to get horizontal dividers like border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd;

The <colgroup> element should be used as a container for the column specifications.
Each group are specified with a <col> element.
The span attribute specifies how many columns that gets the style.
The style attribute specifies the style to give the columns

There are only a very limited selection of CSS properties that are allowed to be used in the colgroup
width property

To style more colgroup have to use more <col> elements inside the <colgroup>
If want to style columns in the middle of a table, insert a "empty" <col> element (with no styles) for the columns before
To Hide Columns You can hide columns with the visibility: collapse property
