HTML - Hyper Text Markup Language
It describes the structure of a web page
It consists of a series of elements
Elements tell the browser how to display the content


HTML Page Structure
Below is a visualization of an HTML page structure:

<html>
<head>
<title>Page title</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<p>This is another paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>



HTMl Elements 
The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document
The <html> element is the root element of an HTML page
The <head> element contains meta information about the HTML page
The <title> element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab)
The <body> element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
The <h1> element defines a large heading
The <p> element defines a paragraph

HTML Elements
An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag.
Elements can be nested and HTML document is of nested html elements.
The <html> element is the root element and it defines the whole HTML document.
It has a start tag <html> and an end tag </html>.
Then, inside the <html> element there is a <body> element

There are some elements tag which need end tag 
for them there is need for them to not skip end tag but they will work without them .
And there is are also elements called Empty HTML elements like <br> tag

HTML is Not Case Sensitive
HTML tags are not case sensitive: <P> means the same as <p>.
The HTML standard does not require lowercase tags, but W3C recommends lowercase in HTML, 
and demands lowercase for stricter document types like XHTML.

====================================================
## HTML Attributes
HTML attributes provide additional information about HTML elements.

All HTML elements can have attributes
Attributes provide additional information about elements
Attributes are always specified in the start tag
Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"
 href attribute of <a> tag
 src attribute of <img> tag
 width and height attributes for img tag
 alt attribute for the <img> tag -  it gives the alternate name if image is not displayed

The style Attribute
The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more.

The lang Attribute
lang attribute inside the <html> tag, to declare the language of the Web page
<html lang="en">
The title Attribute
The title attribute defines some extra information about an element.
=>  Always Quote Attribute Values

Single or Double Quotes?
Both of them are acceptable and double are common.
when the attribute value itself contains double quotes, it is necessary to use single quotes.
====================================================
HTML Headings
HTML headings are titles or subtitles that you want to display on a webpage.
headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags.

<h1> defines the most important heading. 
<h6> defines the least important heading.

Headings Are Important as Search engines use the headings to index the structure and content of your web pages.

We can define bigger heading instead of the default size can increaze the size using the font-size property of css


==================================================
## HTML Paragraphs
A paragraph always starts on a new line, and is usually a block of text.
<p> element defines a paragraph
A paragraph always starts on a new line, 
and browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a paragraph.

With html cannot be certain how will it display body 
With HTML cannot change the display by adding extra spaces or extra lines in your HTML code.
The browser will automatically remove any extra spaces and lines when the page is displayed.

HTML Horizontal Rules - <hr> is  displayed as a horizontal rule.

The HTML <br> element defines a line break.

Can also use the preformatted text means it will display what is written as it is written like it is preformatted.
 The HTML <pre> element defines preformatted text.

The text inside a <pre> element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier),
 and it preserves both spaces and line breaks

HTML Comments

HTML comments are not displayed in the browser,
 but they can help document your HTML source code.
Syntax 
<!-- Write your comments here -->
this can be used to hide the HTML tags and iinline contents too .

HTML Colors

HTML colors are specified with predefined color names, or with RGB, HEX, HSL, RGBA, or HSLA values.

Border Color

style="border:2px solid Tomato;"

Color Values
<h1 style="background-color:rgb(255, 99, 71);">...</h1>
<h1 style="background-color:#ff6347;">...</h1>
<h1 style="background-color:hsl(9, 100%, 64%);">...</h1>

An RGBA color value is an extension of RGB with an
Alpha channel (opacity).

HTML HEX Colors

=====================================================


HTML Styles - CSS
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to format the layout of a webpage.

CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:
Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements
An inline CSS is used to apply a unique style to a single HTML element.
An inline CSS uses the style attribute of an HTML element.


Internal - by using a <style> element in the <head> section
An internal CSS is used to define a style for a single HTML page.

An internal CSS is defined in the <head> section of an HTML page, within a <style> element.



External - by using a <link>
element to link to an external CSS file
An external style sheet is used to define the style for many HTML pages.
To use an external style sheet, add a link to it in the <head> section of each HTML page

 The extenal file must not contain any
HTML code, and must be saved with a .css extension.
Syntax to specify external css in html head
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">

The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS
files.



Use the CSS border property for borders
Use the CSS padding property for space inside the border
Use the CSS margin property for space outside the border

Use the CSS color property for text colors
Use the CSS font-family property for text fonts
Use the CSS font-size property for text sizes
Use the CSS border property for borders
Use the CSS padding property for space inside the border
Use the CSS margin property for space outside the border

===================================================
## HTML Links

Links allow users to click their way from page to page.
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">Visit W3Schools.com!</a>

By default, links will appear as follows in all browsers:
An unvisited link is underlined and blue
A visited link is underlined and purple
An active link is underlined and red

The target Attribute
By default, the linked page will be displayed in the current browser window. 
To change this, you must specify another target for the link.
The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document.

_self - Default. Opens the document in
the same window/tab as it was clicked
_blank - Opens the document in a new window or tab
_parent - Opens the document in the parent frame
_top - Opens the document in the full body of the window

absolute URL (a full web address) in the href attribute.

A local link (a link to a page within the same website) is specified with a relative URL 
(without the "https://www" part)
Use mailto: inside the href attribute to create a link that opens the user's email program (to let them send a new email)
<a href="mailto:someone@example.com">Send email</a>

HTML Links - Different Colors
Css element to change the behaviour 
a:link {
}
a:visited {
}
a:hover {
}
a:active {
}

Create a Bookmark in HTML - 
Link to the same page
Using id
Bookmarks can be useful if a web page is very long.
To create a bookmark - first create the bookmark, then add a link
to it.
When the link is clicked, the page will scroll down or up to the location with the
bookmark.

Use the id attribute (id="value") to define bookmarks in a page
Use the href attribute (href="#value") to link to the bookmark
Or can use the  (href="www.page.html#value") to go that part of page from another page .
================================================

## image HTML

To show image in html <img> tag is used and it has two required
attributes:
src - Specifies the path to the image

alt - Specifies an alternate text for the image
if no image is shown like description of the image

Image Size - Width and Height using direct as attribute or in the style attribute property.

Image can be be in the same folder or another folder, or on another server and website just have to give the correct address in the src attribute.

we can also give the animated imgaes to the img elements
and can also use the image as the link in the <a>  tag 

Image can also float using 
 the CSS float property let the image float to the right or to the left of a text.

 HTML Image Maps

 The HTML <map> tag defines an image map.
  An image map is an image with clickable areas. 
 The areas are defined with one or more <area> tags.
 The idea behind an image map is that you should be able to perform different actions depending on where in the image you click.
 he only difference from other images is that you must add a usemap attribute

 <img src="workplace.jpg" alt="Workplace" usemap="#workmap">
 Then, add a <map> element.
The <map> element is used to create an image map, and is linked to the image by using the required name attribute
<map name="workmap">
The area of the click in the image can be 
rectangle - need coordinate of the diagonal
circle - need coordinat eof the centre and radius
poly - need coordinate of the every corner.

<area shape= "rect" coords="34, 44, 270,350" href="link">

HTML Background Images
To add a background image on an HTML element, use the HTML style attribute and the CSS background-image property
<p style="background-image: url('img_girl.jpg');">

but if want to show background image for hte page have to give  in the body element tag
body {
  background-image: url('img_girl.jpg');
}

If the background image is smaller than the element, the image will repeat itself, horizontally and vertically, until it reaches the end of the element
So, To avoid the background image from repeating itself, set the background-repeat property
to no-repeat
Can also set background-size to cover to the cover the whole element.
Can   set  background-size: 100% 100%; to strech the image
  background-attachment: fixed; this property is used to make the image fixed and entire element is always covered.


HTML <picture> Element
The HTML <picture> element allows you to display different pictures for different devices or screen sizes.
The <picture> element contains one or more <source> elements, each referring to different images through the srcset attribute.
 This way the browser can choose the image that best fit the current view and/or device.
Each <source> element has a media attribute that defines when the image is the most suitable and in that will have to define the dimension whiich suits that image the most.
<picture>
  <source media="(min-width: 650px)" srcset="img_food.jpg">
  <source media="(min-width: 465px)" srcset="img_car.jpg">
  <img src="img_girl.jpg">
</picture>

This element is used for 2 main reasons
1. to save the bandwidth and to laosd the most appropriate image nned according to device as small device would need only small image.
and 2. would be the format support if one donot support some format it would give diffrent image format to show.


HTML Favicon - A favicon is a small image displayed next to the page title in the browser tab. it is the .ico file .

it is declared in the head element tag of the 
<link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="/images/favicon.ico">
