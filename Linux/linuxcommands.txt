Directory Structure


Command Syntax
This command syntax will be the same for every command that you will use in Linux.

command [-argument] [-argument] [--argument] [file]
Examples:
ls List files in the current directory
ls -l Lists files in “long” format
ls -l --color As above, with colorized output
cat filename Show contents of a file

Name - Change Directory
Purpose- navigate the directory in the linux terminal 
Examples- cd is the command used to change the directory 
Syntax - cd [directory_name] 
cd /  =>change the directory to the root directory
cd dir_1/dir_2/dir_3 => to move to inside of the directory
cd ~ / cd=> used to change the directory to the home directory
cd .. => goes 1 directory back
cd "dir name" or cd dir\ name => this used to navigate to the directory with the white spaces
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Name -       Delete Folder
Purpose-  Deletes the folder  
Examples- rmdir is used to remove the emplty folder  
rmdir [-p] [-v | –verbose] [–ignore-fail-on-non-empty] directories 
here -p =>option each of the directory argument is treated as a pathname of which all
 components will be removed, if they are already empty, starting from the last component
-v/-verbose => this option will show the verbose info
–ignore-fail-on-non-empty => this option will not report failure if the direcotry is not empty
itsacheckmate@itsacheckmate:~/Training$ rmdir a
itsacheckmate@itsacheckmate:~/Training$ ls
'a b'   b   git   Linux   PostgreSQL   README.md
itsacheckmate@itsacheckmate:~/Training$ rmdir 'a b' b
itsacheckmate@itsacheckmate:~/Training$ rmdir git
rmdir: failed to remove 'git': Directory not empty
itsacheckmate@itsacheckmate:~/Training$ mkdir a b s
itsacheckmate@itsacheckmate:~/Training$ rmdir -v a
rmdir: removing directory, 'a'

#####
rm - it is the remove command which deletes the objects such as files,directories , symbolic links etc.
and if the command has executed it cant be undone.
rm [option] .... FILE ...
rm a.txt deletes the a.txt file
rm -i a.txt => this asks for confirmation before deleting the file
rm -f a.txt => if the file is write protected it foces to delete it but wont work in the write protected directories
-r (recursive option)- it will perform a tree-walk and will delete all the files and sub-directories recursively
normally rm donot delete directory but using this option it will delete the directory
rm -r *

use -- before file name if file name starts with -
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

rename -n=>if the user want  to see only final change
rename -o =>will not overwrite existing files
rename -V => shows the version
rename -help=> help message and exit
itsacheckmate@itsacheckmate:~/Training/Linux/practice$ rename -v 's/a1/b' a.txt

CP vs SCP
#scp or Secure Copy is primarily used to copy between a local host and remote host, or two remote hosts, via ssh
scp copies files between hosts on a network.  It uses ssh(1) for data transfer, and uses the same authentication
 and provides the same security as     ssh(1).  Unlike rcp(1), scp will ask for passwords or passphrases if they are needed for authentication.
# The cp command is for copying files locally, i.e. within your host's system.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Files
Name -       pwd
Purpose-    Print Working Directory				   pwd is shell built-in command(pwd) or an actual binary(/bin/pwd).
Examples- It has 2 options -[LP]
					pwd -L: Prints the symbolic path. it is default command shwon by pwd 
					Also by the $pwd variable value is shown
					pwd -P: Prints the actual path.It is the path shown by /bin/pwd
itsacheckmate@itsacheckmate:~/tmp$ pwd -L
/home/itsacheckmate/tmp
itsacheckmate@itsacheckmate:~/tmp$ pwd -P
/home/itsacheckmate/tmp
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Name -       Chmod
Purpose-      Change the access mode of the file i.e what user have the permission on the file 
wether they can edit it, or read or execute the file or the directory .
Examples- Syntax is chmod [reference][operator][mode] file... 
Here the reference is whoh the permission apply it is represented by folloing letters
Reference   Class     Description
u          owner      file's owner

g          group      users who are members of
                      the file's group

o          others     users who are neither the
                      file's owner nor members of 
                      the file's group

a          all       All three of the above, same as ugo
Then there is operator which specify how the modes of files should be adjusted
Operator  Description
+         Adds the specified modes to the
          specified classes

-         Removes the specified modes from 
          the specified classes

=         The modes specified are to be made
          the exact modes for the specified 
          classes
and the the modes which indicate which permission is to be granted
r       Permission to read the file.
w       Permission to write (or delete) the file.
x       Permission to execute the file, or, in
        the case of a directory, search it.

the very first column represents the type of the file 
if its is a directory  'd' or if its a file the  '-'
then the folling 3set of letter represents the permission of the file owner
rwx =all three permission or rw- = only the read and write permission 

Then the following set off 3 letters are the group permission and other user permission
respectively 
if the directory has only x permission it means that there is premission to search the directory

Then it spescifies the owner and the group which owner belons to  
 Octal notaions could be used for this
 octal    binary   fileMode
 0			000			---
 1			001			--x
 2			010			-w-
 3			011			-wx
 4			100			r--
 5			101			r-x
 6			110			rw-
 7			111			rwx
 
 so for user,group,and other permission willl be written as
 - rwx--x--x => 711

Recursive Permission change - it is used to change the permission of multiple files in the 
directory at once   chmod -R is used with find command
Change all the files 
sudo find /path/to/someDirectory -type f -print0 | xargs -0 sudo chmod 644
change for all the directory
sudo find /path/to/someDirectory -type d -print0 | xargs -0 sudo chmod 755

Sticky Bit - It applies only to the directory and specially used by the derictory which is publicly available 
it prevents the user to deleting and remaning any file which they do not personally own  for thsi 't' flag is used
chmod +t <directory>
chmod -t <directory>

Name -       shutdown
Purpose-    used to shutdown the system in a safe way.
Examples- syntax shutdown [OPTIONS] [TIME] [MESSAGE]
					sudo shutdown
					to shutdown the system at a specified time
The time argument can have two different formats
schedule a system shutdown at 05 A.M:
sudo shutdown 05:00
 system shutdown in 20 minutes from now:
sudo shutdown +20

to  broadcast a custom message
sudo shutdown +10 "System upgrade"

itsacheckmate@itsacheckmate:~/Training$ sudo shutdown +1 "System upgrade"
[sudo] password for itsacheckmate: 
Shutdown scheduled for Mon 2022-04-18 19:11:26 IST, use 'shutdown -c' to cancel.


How to halt your system
This can be achieved using the -H option.

shutdown -H
Halting means stopping all CPUs and powering off also makes sure the main power is disconnected.

How to make shutdown power-off machine
Although this is by default, you can still use the -P option to explicitly specify that you want shutdown to power off the system.

shutdown -P
How to reboot using shutdown
For reboot, the option is -r.

shutdown -r
You can also specify a time argument and a custom message:

shutdown -r +5 "Updating Your System"
The command above will reboot the system after 5 minutes and broadcast Updating Your System”

If you have scheduled a shutdown and you want to cancel it you can use the -c argument:

sudo shutdown -c
 cannot specify a time argument, but can still broadcast a message 

sudo shutdown -c "Canceling the reboot"
