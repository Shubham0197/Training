Active Record Callbacks
The Object Life Cycle
objects may be created, updated, and destroyed. Active Record provides hooks into this object life cycle
Callbacks allow to trigger logic before or after an alteration of an object's state.

Callbacks Overview
In order to use the available callbacks, you need to register them. You can implement the callbacks as ordinary methods and use a macro-style class method to register them as callbacks
The macro-style class methods can also receive a block. Consider using this style if the code inside your block is so short that it fits in a single line
It is considered good practice to declare callback methods as private. If left public, they can be called from outside of the model and violate the principle of object encapsulation.
Callbacks can also be registered to only fire on certain life cycle events
