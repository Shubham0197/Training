webpacker
Raisl 6 and above uses webpacker by default
sprocket was used before .
They were used to manage and serve the assest to the application.
Webpacker is a rails wrapper around the webpack that provides reaonabledefaults
webpack is a system that allows to write front - end code in a way that is convinient for the developers and then package that code in a way that is convinient for browsers.
with this can manage javascript , css and static assets like images.
Sprockets is simpler to integrate and is compatible more to work with lagacy web application.
but webpacker is uptodate with the most latest modern javascript and rails.
To include Webpacker in a new project, add --webpack to the rails new command. 
To add Webpacker to an existing project, add the webpacker gem to the project's Gemfile, run bundle install, and then run bin/rails webpacker:install.

Webpacker adds a webpacker:compile task to the assets:precompile rake task, so any existing deploy pipeline that was using assets:precompile should work. 
The compile task will compile the packs and place them in public/packs
