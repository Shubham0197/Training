Action View
Web requests are handled by Action Controller and Action View.
Action View is then responsible for compiling the response.

Naming Convention in rails 
The views share their name with the associated controller action
The complete HTML returned to the client is composed of a combination of this ERB file, a layout template that wraps it, and all the partials that the view may reference.
So for book action in library controller the corrresponding view would be in library subfolder in 
view the file would be book.html.erb
Templates
If the template file has a .erb extension then it uses a mixture of ERB (Embedded Ruby) and HTML
If the template file has a .builder extension then the Builder::XmlMarkup library is used.

1. ERB
So to run ruby code in erb have to write code in <% ... %>
The <% %> tags are used to execute Ruby code that does not return anything, such as conditions, loops, or blocks, and the <%= %> tags are used when you want output.

(<%= %>). regular output functions such as print and puts won't be rendered to the view with ERB templates so instead of them have to write = replace insteaad of print or puts


Action Helpers 
Helpers are use to extract complex logic out of view so that we cn qrganize the code better.
eg, link_to, form_for, img_
or can also make new helper method in the application helper  in the helper folder

can also write specific for the specific controller view like for aircraft_helper method written in this will only be available for the view of aircraft controller but if want to define helper method whichi is available for the all the views will have to define them in the application helper. 

Can also write ht ehelper method in the controller
either by wriing helper_method :method_name

or include ApplicationHelper
