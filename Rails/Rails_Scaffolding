Scaffolding 
A scaffold is a set of automatically generated files which forms the basic structure of a Rails project.
These files include:

A controller
A model
Views for every standard controller action (index, edit, show, new)

Scaffolding provides more than cheap demo thrills. Here are some benefits −

You can quickly get code in front of your users for feedback.
You are motivated by faster success.
You can learn how Rails works by looking at the generated code.
You can use scaffolding as a foundation to jump start your development.

rails g scaffold books
This example creates:

A BooksController
A Book model
A new resources :books route added to your config/routes.rb file
A set of testing-related files
View files under app/views/books (five in total)


This can aslo be undone by the follwing destroy command

If you want to undo this scaffolding, right after creating it, you can use the following command.

rails d scaffold books

Where “d” means “destroy”.

Also Before you can use your scaffolded code you have to run your migrations to update your database schema.
we have to use the rails db:migrate command.

Here while generating rthe scaffold the model only gets timestamp fields, which means that the only information that you can record about your books (or whatever model you’re working with) is the time at which they were created, or updated.

We can add the diferent fields while creating the scaffold to add different fields to the table to add meaningufl data to.

rails g scaffold paper title:string author:string publication_year:integer
      invoke  active_record
      create    db/migrate/20220622110623_create_papers.rb
      create    app/models/paper.rb
      invoke    test_unit
      create      test/models/paper_test.rb
      create      test/fixtures/papers.yml
      invoke  resource_route
       route    resources :papers
      invoke  scaffold_controller
      create    app/controllers/papers_controller.rb
      invoke    erb
      create      app/views/papers
      create      app/views/papers/index.html.erb
      create      app/views/papers/edit.html.erb
      create      app/views/papers/show.html.erb
      create      app/views/papers/new.html.erb
      create      app/views/papers/_form.html.erb
      create      app/views/papers/_paper.html.erb
      invoke    resource_route
      invoke    test_unit
      create      test/controllers/papers_controller_test.rb
      create      test/system/papers_test.rb
      invoke    helper
      create      app/helpers/papers_helper.rb
      invoke      test_unit
      invoke    jbuilder
      create      app/views/papers/index.json.jbuilder
      create      app/views/papers/show.json.jbuilder
      create      app/views/papers/_paper.json.jbuilder

This will add the title author and publication fields to the table and the controlled and views while creating the scaffold .
