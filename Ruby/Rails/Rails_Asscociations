Active Records Associations
In Rails, an association is a connection between two Active Record models
With Active Record associations, we can streamline  operations by declaratively telling Rails that there is a connection between the two models

The Types of Associations
Rails supports six types of associations:

belongs_to
has_one
has_many
has_many :through
has_one :through
has_and_belongs_to_many

belong _to associations
it sets up a connection with another model,
 such that each instance of the declaring model
 "belongs to" one instance of the other model.
 When used alone, belongs_to produces a one-directional one-to-one connection. 
 belongs_to does not ensure reference consistency, 
 so depending on the use case, you might also need to add a database-level 
 foreign key constraint on the reference column,

The has_one Association
A has_one association indicates that one other model has a reference to this model. 
That model can be fetched through this association.
